# Web Development Repository

Welcome to my Web Development repository! Here, you can explore both my daily practice logs and various projects related to web development.


## [Practice Logs Repository](Web_Development/web_dev_practice)

In the practice repository, you will find detailed logs and code snippets of my daily web development practice. Each markdown file corresponds to a different area of web development:

- [HTML & CSS Practice](Web_Development/web_dev_practice/javascript_practice.md)
- [JavaScript Practice](Web_Development/web_dev_practice/javascript_practice.md)


Feel free to explore each section to see my progress and code examples.


## [Projects Repository](Web_Development/Projects/)

In the projects repository, I upload larger projects associated with web development. Each project folder contains its own README file with descriptions, setup instructions, and more details about the project.

Here are some examples of projects you can find:

- [Project A](projects/project-a/README.md)

Explore each project to learn more about the specific goals, technologies used, and outcomes.
